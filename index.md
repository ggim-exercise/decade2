## Location
Virtual meeting 

## Concept note
The effects of weather, climate, climate change, conflict and seismic activity, as well as the current pandemic, continue to make many populations vulnerable around the world. Our collective need to build resilient communities and respond when people are in most need is pressured by limited preparedness and resources. Geospatial science and technology is an intelligent way forward to make best use of those resource as it plays crucial roles across the disaster management cycle; to model the risks and hazards, identify and support vulnerable populations and infrastructure, provide early warning to prepare for disasters or provide early action to support those populations at risk, and understand after an emergency who and what has been affected, what support is needed and who is delivering that aid.

With governments, local authorities, international organisations, regional bodies and civil society all requiring accurate information to help build resilience and respond for a wide range of scenarios, one geospatial solution does not suit all. This workshop aims to look at geospatial information and technical solutions from several different perspectives to identify the commonalities, share knowledge across disaster management systems and identify some of the bottlenecks and challenges, such as data sharing and discovery, that need innovative thinking.  The response of the geospatial community to disaster management sits within UN-GGIM's larger Integrated Geospatial Information Framework (IGIF) goal of strengthening mapping and analytical services across society.  The dialogue at this workshop, though, starts to move us from the generic to a greater understanding of the needs of the disaster management and humanitarian systems so we, as geospatial experts, can tailor our work to better suit those requirements.

[Task Group B](https://ggim-exercise.github.io) of the Working Group on Geospatial Information and Services for Disasters (WG-Disasters) under the [United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management](https://ggim.un.org) has been [working online](https://github.com/ggim-exercise) for a practical UN geospatial cooperation for the aim of the WG-Disasters. 

Although we have various operation-oriented participants, we still have no single scenario we can work together. We believe it is partly because we still need to develop flexibility to find a common ground where we can combine efforts in the actual fields. 

From this perspective, we are having 2-hour online session with presentations by international humanitarian charity and academia who kindly bring their scenario and cases. 

Each presenter will kindly provide us the following points: 

1. Scenario of disaster or disaster risk reduction used in the presentation
2. Actions proposed following the scenario
3. Examples of actions already taken

## Agenda
1. Alan Mills (MapAction): Geospatial Service Requirements for Effective Humanitarian Response (30 minutes including questions and answers)
2. Taichi Furuhashi et al. (Aoyama Gakuin University): UNVT Community in operation (30 minutes including questions and answers)

## How to register
Please register to the **Geospatial Capacity Development Conference on GNSS applications and DRR** (registration process still confirming) because this workshop is a part of the conference.
