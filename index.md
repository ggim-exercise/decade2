## Hosted by
Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (GSI), UN-GGIM Working Group on Geospatial Information and Services for Disasters (WG-Disasters), and UN-GGIM-AP

## Location
Virtual meeting 

## Concept note
[Task Group B](https://ggim-exercise.github.io) of the Working Group on Geospatial Information and Services for Disasters (WG-Disasters) under the [United Nations Committee of Experts on Global Geospatial Information Management](https://ggim.un.org) has been [working online](https://github.com/ggim-exercise) for a practical UN geospatial cooperation for the aim of the WG-Disasters. 

Although we have various operation-oriented participants, we still have no single scenario we can work together. We believe it is partly because we still need to develop flexibility to find a common ground we can combine efforts. 

From this perspective, we are having 2-hour online session with presentations by international humanitarian charity and academia who kindly bring their scenario and cases. 

Each presenter will kindly provide us the following points: 

1. Scenario of disaster or disaster risk reduction used in the presentation
2. Actions proposed following the scenario
3. Examples of actions already taken

## Agenda
1. PRESENTER, MapAction: TITLE (30 minutes including questions and answers)
2. PRESENTER, Aoyama Gakuin University: TITLE (30 minutes including questions and answers)
